Full installation instructions can be found in the User's Guide.
A quick installation guide follows below.

ITSx requires Perl and HMMER3.

1) Perl is usually installed on Unix-like systems by default. If not, it can be retrieved from http://www.perl.org/

2) HMMER3 can be found at http://hmmer.janelia.org/software
Download it and follow the on site instructions for installation.

3) Obtain the ITSx package from http://microbiology.se/software/itsx
Unpack the tarball and move into the newly created "ITSx" directory.

4) Copy the ITSx file and the ITSx_db directory to your preferred bin directory.

5) To test if ITSx was successfully installed type "ITSx --help" on the command-line. You should now see the ITSx help message.


To run ITSx, you need a FASTA-formatted output file. You can e.g. use the test.fasta file supplied with the package. To check for ITS sequences in the test file, type "ITSx -i test.fasta -o test" on the command line. If you are on a multicore machine, you might want to use the "--cpu 2" option to speed up the processes by using two (or more) cores.

New features in this version:
- Improvements to the '--anchor HMM' option
- Full-length ITS region output now also outputs anchor sequences
